"""
This is the root module of the `konanai` package, a comprehensive solution for
high-level speech and language processing tasks. It encompasses a broad range
of capabilities including time-series analysis, linguistic processing,
non-linear data representation, and empirical analyses.

This package is subdivided into four integral sub-modules:
- `domains`: This module encapsulates the time-domain and linguistic-domain
             analyses, transformations between time-frequency domains, and the
             generation of various data representations.
- `externals`: This module provides user-friendly wrappers for integrating
               cutting-edge external tools, such as UMAP, OpenSMILE, and
               CharSIU, enhancing the extensibility of `konanai`.
- `models`: This module hosts sophisticated acoustic and phonetic estimators,
            providing the foundation for advanced machine learning
            applications.
- `empirics`: This module offers robust tools for empirical research,
              including capabilities for conducting sophisticated ablation
              studies.
