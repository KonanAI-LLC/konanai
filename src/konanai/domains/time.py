    The `Time` class is a comprehensive representation for time-series data.

    The class is designed to handle and operate on time data. It supports
    various functionalities including conversion between time units such as
    seconds and frames, validating time data and units, and generating
    printable representations.

    The class utilizes the factory method pattern through its class methods for
    conversion operations. These class methods provide a standard interface for
    creating `Time` objects in different units. Instance methods and properties
    are used to operate on these objects.
